    \section intro_sec Introduction
    
    Welcome to the Automatic Mock Object Library (AMOP). Our goal is: Let's us creating a 
    mock object in C++ much easier. By using an ABI based implementation, we can create 
    our mock object in only one statement:

    \code
    TMockObject<YourInterface> mock;
    \endcode
        
    And then we can create our test and set the expect values into it, without writing 
    the implementation of your interface. The time is saved and when adding a new function 
    in your interface, there are no needed to added it in your 'poor-man' implementation. 

    \section limitation
    
    Because of AMOP is based on ABI of C++, there are some limitations:

    - Only supports __cdecl calling convention., 
    which is the default calling convention of almost all compliers 
    - Only supports Pure Virtual Classes 
    ( No member variables, No non virtual member funtions )
    - Only supports Single Inheritance Interface.
    - The maximum number of virtual functions of your interface 
    should be lower than MAX_NUM_VIRTUAL_FUNCTIONS. 
    (The default is 50, you can changed it in amop/Config.h, but it will slow down the compiler)
    
    \section need_help More?
    
    We are trying to document all usable classes and functions in here, but maybe that is not 
    covered all your needs, just feel free to ask your question in our google group
    (http://groups.google.com/group/amop-group).
